# adventOfCode2021

My (vanilla JS-based) solutions for the 2021 [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) puzzles!

## Stuff I Learned:
### Day 1
* Problem 1.1: I needed to refresh my memory on imports and exports outside of the React/React Native world I usually inhabit. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63588714/node9374-warning-to-load-an-es-module-set-type-module) Stack Overflow question helped me update my package.json to allow me to use `import` syntax. Looks like I could have used `require` syntax instead, according to [this other Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61401475/why-is-type-module-in-package-json-file).
* [Arraythis.com](https://arraythis.com/) rules! \m/
* I should probably go back and do this without using arraythis later, lol.
* 1.2: The [Sliding Window Technique](https://algodaily.com/lessons/a-birds-eye-view-into-sliding-windows) (SWT) is 1. A Thing That Exists 2. A handy [tool for solving algorithms](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-sliding-window-strategy-for-solving-algorithms-34c95c80c506).
